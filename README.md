# PICKLE RICK APP --> [pickle-rick-weld.vercel.app](https://pickle-rick-weld.vercel.app/)

In this website, you can display locations and characters. You can filter characters by status and add characters to favorites.

* Used next.js Framework.
* Used **slugify** to optimize url params.
* Used **react-loading-skeleton** for loading effect.
* Used **fontawesome** for icons.
* Used **redux-toolkit**

## Missing stuff I have not added:

* Usage SSR/SSG instead of CSR.
* Generation dynamic params and meta data (open graph image included) for better SEO.
* Refresh page on click filter buttons.
* Reset scroll on change page on mobile view.
* Back navigation icon
* Pagination position
* Breadcrumbs
* Error state UI
* UI for empty characters screen.
